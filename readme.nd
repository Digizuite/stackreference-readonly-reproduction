When you have two stacks—a *parent* and a *child*—where the child references the parent via a `StackReference`, moving both stacks to a different organization can cause the child’s deployment to fail. This happens because the `StackReference` isn’t updated to reflect the new organization, even though its underlying value has changed. The `StackReference` is created using a variable, but modifying that variable does not produce a diff, so the child’s stack remains tied to the old reference.
